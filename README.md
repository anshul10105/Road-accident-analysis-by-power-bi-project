## **This project analyzes road accident data using Power BI to uncover patterns, identify high-risk areas, and highlight contributing factors.**
## **The goal is to help policy makers, traffic authorities, and the public understand accident trends and work towards reducing road mishaps.**

### Objectives

1.**Track accident trends over years and months.**

2.**Identify peak accident times (time of day, weekdays vs weekends).**

3.**Analyze severity levels (fatal, serious, minor)**

4.**Study vehicle type involvement (cars, two-wheelers etc.)**

5.**Examine the effect of road types and weather conditions.**


### Tools & Technologies

Power BI Desktop – Dashboard and visualization.

Power Query – Data cleaning and transformation.

Excel/CSV Dataset – Road accident records.

### Dashboard Features

**Trend Analysis** – Yearly and monthly accident distribution.

**Severity Breakdown** – Fatal, serious, and slight accidents.

**Road Type Analysis** – Highways, rural, and urban areas.

**Vehicle Category Analysis** – Two-wheelers, cars, heavy vehicles.

**Time & Weather Impact** – Influence of time of day and weather on accidents.

### Key Insights

1. Accidents peak during evenings and weekends, especially in urban areas.

2. Two-wheelers and cars are the most involved vehicle types.

3. Rainy weather conditions contribute to higher accident severity.

4. Highways, while having fewer accidents, show greater fatality rates.

5. Certain regions consistently appear as accident hotspots.

### Conclusion

**This project provides a data-driven understanding of road accidents, helping uncover when, where, and why accidents occur most frequently**.
**The insights highlight the urgent need for:**

**Improved traffic rules enforcement.**

**Better infrastructure and road design.**

**Awareness campaigns for high-risk groups (two-wheeler riders, young drivers).**

Targeted safety measures in accident-prone regions.

By leveraging analytics, authorities can make informed policy decisions that may significantly reduce accidents and save lives.
